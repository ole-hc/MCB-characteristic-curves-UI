# MCB-characteristic-curves-UI
Interactive mapping of the characteristic curves of a miniature circuit breaker (MCB). Programmed in Python, this repository provides a user interface that allows the selection of different characteristic curves and the calculation of the MCB's tripping point depending on the rated current.


# Project progress
I've designed a first visual UI prototype shown in the picture below. I tried to keep the UI simple and intuitive using colors to guide the user to visual only or action elements. A dark design with blue accents is used as the color scheme, as this conveys a professional and elegant impression.
